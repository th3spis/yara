#YARATORIUM: An easy yara labo

throwable directory is meant to containt a compilation of public yara rules that are throuwable outside VirusTotal, since most of public yaras are defined for VT

yarale throws all yaras from a specific location, against a specified location or current dir if none is given

yaralizer reads from a text file and creates a yararule taking each line as a string for the rule
